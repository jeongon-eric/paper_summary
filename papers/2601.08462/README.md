## Abstract

We introduce M3-BENCH for process-aware evaluation of LLM agents in mixed-motive games. M3-BENCH uses three modules: BTA, RPA, and CCA to analyze behavior, reasoning, and communication. Results reveal misalignment between these aspects.

## Introduction

Understanding social behaviors in AI agents is crucial for real-world deployment. Existing evaluations focus on outcomes, not processes.

Problem: We know WHAT agents do, but not WHY or HOW they decide.

M3-BENCH addresses this with:
- **BTA**: What behaviors emerge over time?
- **RPA**: What reasoning leads to those behaviors?
- **CCA**: How do agents communicate?

This reveals internal consistency and helps build more reliable social AI.
